# Project details
## Logical structure
From a logical point of view, the system has a 3-tiered REST application architecture. It is a modular client-server architecture that consists of a presentation tier, an application tier and a data tier.

![REST](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/master/pictures/threetierrest2.png)

- **Presentation tier**  
Comunicates with other two tiers and holds GUI. It is built with Angular, HTML, CSS, and a TypeScript as a front end logic. Communication with the other tiers is established through API calls.

- **Application tier**  
Handles application logic. It consists of two separate servers, Node.js server (written in JavaScript) and a Django server (written in Python). Their primary purpose is to support the application’s core functions and fetch/post user data from databases throughtout database server calls. 

- **Data tier**  
Stores user related information. The data tier consists of a two database servers:
    - MongoDB server and its database, as far as Robo 3T DBMS
    - MySQL server and corresponding database, as far as MySQL DBMS  

   MongoDB databse is, due to its non relational nature, used for storing user access credentials, reference to a user bank account number and other user-centered information.
   
   MySQL database is used to store users bank account details and all related transaction details. 

## Presentation tier
### Front end
- **Design principles**  
  User interface design was conducted according to the usability guidlines given in [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) by Jacob Nielsen. It recommends following heuristcis for UI design:
  - 1: Visibility of system status  
    *The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.*  
    
    Examples (left picture - Sign In visibility status, right picture - Recent Transactions visibility status):  
    
    ![REST](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/master/pictures/fetch.PNG)
    ![REST](https://github.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/blob/master/pictures/fetching%202.PNG)

  - 2: Match between system and the real world  
     *The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user.*  
     
     One way to accomplish this requirement is to use methapore to symbolicly represent apstarct idea of real world expirience. For example, opposite arrows icon can be a good real life metaphore for banking transactions:  
     
      ![REST](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/master/pictures/methaphore.PNG)
     
  - 3: User control and freedom  

  - 4: Consistency and standards  
  *Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.*  

    During front end develpoment, [Google Material Design](https://material.io/design/introduction/#principles) principles were followed.

  - 5: Error prevention  
  
  - 6: Recognition rather than recall  
  *Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.*  

    Stylized door icon can be a good replacement for Sign Out label:  
    
    ![REST](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/master/pictures/recognize.PNG) 
   
  - 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use  
  *Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user.*  
  Three out of six [Gestalt grouping principles of visual perception](https://webspace.ringling.edu/~ccjones/curricula/07-08/seqdesign/Gestalt.pdf) were used during development:
   - Similarity
   - Symmetry
   - Closure  
   
     Example of the closure and similarity principles:  
   
     ![Gestalt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/master/pictures/gestalt1.PNG)  
   
     Example of the symmetry principle:  
   
     ![Gestalt2](https://github.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/blob/master/pictures/gestalt2.PNG)
    
  - 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design  
  *Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility*.

  - 9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors  
  *Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.*

  - 10: Help and documentation  
  *Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search and focused on the user's task.*  
   Help section is mainly focused on a video help instructions, because they are:  
     - Easy to understand
     - Short 
     - Easily seen
     - Contain minimum amount of task specific information  
     
- **Component organisation and architecture**  
  Each Angular front end component consists of three files:
   - HTML template
   - CSS template
   - TypeScript controller  
   
  TypeScript controller's task is to store all variables relevant for component HTML part as far as functions to make calls
  for service controllers (service controllers are TypeScript modules wich initiate API server calls).
- **Services**
  - Authentication service
  - Dashboard service
  - Posts service
  - Auth guard
  - Auth interceptor
  
## Application tier
### Node.js server
This is the main application server. It communicates with database and Django servers through API server calls.

Server is capable of executing following tasks:
 - User Sign Up/Sign In
 - Tokenization service (auto authentication if user authenticated user close or reloads web page, auto user sign out after token expiration)
 - Handling HTTP PUT, POST and GET requests
 - Getting all user information from databases (make database queries)
 - MIME type validation and image upload handling
 - Formating and preparing data in convenient format to be shown on front end
 - Creating, editing and deleting of user transactions
 
### Django server
This server has two implemented API services:
 - **Dummy data service**  
   When a new user signs up, this service sends random JSON object to Node.js sever upon request. JSON object contains random data (mobile phone number, branch name, and home address) pulled out of .csv file (or as a random number in case of phone number) on Django server. After data receiving, Node.js server updates corrensponing user data in MongoDB with the data provided.  
   
 - **Exchange rates service**  
    This service sends API calls to the free [Exchange rates API](https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/), formats retreived data and sends it back to the Node.js server.  
 
## Data tier
### MongoDB database
Database holds data related to a user account and user transactios. User transactions are stored only temporarily in this databse (such data should be held in relational database). Also, it is connected with 1-1 relation through foreign key (bankAccount filed) with MySQL table account (private key accountID). In the further development it will be shifted to a MySQL Database, and will be connected through _ id field with customerID table in MySQL. Here is the model of database:  

 ![mongoDB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/master/pictures/mongodb.png)

### MySQL database
- **Testing database**  
  At the moment, this database is used only for testing purposes. It has 4 tables and it is also connected with MongoDB through foreign   key field clientID. 
  ![mySql](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/master/pictures/mysql1.png)  

- **Real-world database (work in progress)**  
  This databse has been developed according to the several international standards used in an IT banking systems:  
  
  - **ISO 20022 Financial Services - Universal financial industry message scheme**  
    As a result of guidelines and schemes presented in this standard, following tables were modeled:  
    
    ![transactionCode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/master/pictures/transactnCode.PNG)  
    
    Example:  
    Suppose we want to list last nine possible transaction codes and its corrensponding names related to Issued Real-Time Credit Transfer payments (as defined in ISO 20022).  
    Then, we would form the following SQL query:  
    
        `SELECT 
            PK_transaction_code_id,
            FK_transaction_domain_id,
            domain_code, domain_name,
            family_code, family_name,
            subfamily_code,
            subfamily_name
    
         FROM
            ref_transaction_code,
            ref_transaction_domain,
            ref_transaction_family,
            ref_transaction_subfamily
    
         WHERE
            domain_code = "PMNT" &&
            family_code = "IRCT" &&
            FK_transaction_domain_id = PK_transaction_domain_id &&
            FK_transaction_family_id = PK_transaction_family_id &&
            FK_transaction_subfamily_id = PK_transaction_subfamily_id
    
         ORDER BY subfamily_code DESC
    
         LIMIT 9`
    
    and would get the next query result:  
    
    ![queryRes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/master/pictures/transactionCodes.PNG)  
    
  - **BAI2 codes**  
    ISO 20022 suggests using the BAI code appended to the transaction code. So, the following table is created, and together with
    transaction code table uniquely identifies transaction type:  
    
    ![transactionType](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/master/pictures/transactionType.PNG)  
    
  - **ISO 18245:2003 Retail financial services** - Merchant category codes (MCC)  
    This standard was used for the merchant category table modeling. This table stores MCC codes upon wich all electronic payments (card payments) are standardized and categorized.  
    
     ![mcc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/master/pictures/Merchant.PNG)  
     
   - **ISO 3166-1 alpha-3** - Three-letter country codes   
   
      ![alpha3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/master/pictures/Country%20code.PNG)  
      
   - **ISO 4217** - Currency designators  
     This standard delineates currency designators, country codes (alpha and numeric), and references to minor units.
     It was used for the creation of currency codes table.
   
      ![alpha3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/master/pictures/Currency.PNG)  

Complete EER diagram of the database can be seen [here](https://github.com/matejavulic/Ebank-Web-App/blob/master/pdfs/EER_diagram_database.pdf).
